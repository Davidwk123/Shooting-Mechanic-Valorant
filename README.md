# Shooting-Mechanic-Valorant

Part of the shooting mechanic in Valorant Developed with Unreal Engine 5.

Attempted to develop the bullet damage drop off mechanic, where the player's weapon does less damage the father away they are from their opponent. 

Used the Ghost's weapon stats when working on feature.  


I did not create the game assets. The Game asset credits are listed on the itch.io link
