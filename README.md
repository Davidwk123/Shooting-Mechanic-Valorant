Part of the shooting mechanic in Valorant Developed with Unreal Engine 5.

Attempted to develop the bullet damage drop off mechanic, where the player's weapon does less damage the farther away they are from their opponent. 

Used Unreal Engine's FPS project framework.

Used the Ghost's weapon stats when working on feature.
